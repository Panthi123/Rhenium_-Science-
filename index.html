            <h1>All About Rhenium</h1>
            <br>
            <h1>Why I Picked Rhenium</h1>
            <h3>I picked the element Rhenium because it is one of the coolest elements on the periodic table. It has one of the highest melting points of all the elements on the periodic table. Only Tungsten and Carbon have higher melting points. Another reason why I want to adopt Rhenium is because it is one of the most dense elements on the periodic table. Only iridium, osmium, and platinum are more dense. The density of Rhenium is 21020 kg m-3.</h3>
            <br>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <h3>Rhenium was discovered in 1925. Rhenium was discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg. Rhenium originated from the Rhines provinces of Germany. Rhenium’s name was from the Greek word “Rhenus” meaning river “Rhine”. The discoverers had announced that they had detected the element (Rhenium) in Platinum’s ores and columbite. Platinum is an element on the periodic table that is dense, malleable, ductile, and very precious. Columbite is a radioactive mineral found in Mozambique. Columbite, a black mineral, consists of a niobium oxide of iron. Rhenium is used in many things as a strong, hard and cool metal.            </h3>
            <br>
             <h1>Common Uses Of Rhenium</h1>
             <h3>Rhenium is used with platinum as catalysts in the production of lead-free, high-octane gasoline. 

                Rhenium is also used in alloys for jet engines. Alloy is a metal made by combining two or more metallic elements.These alloys are also used for x-ray machines. It is also a component in superalloys for blades in turbine engines, and this is the major use today.
                
                It is also used as an electrical contact material. 
                
                Rhenium is also an ideal metal for rocket motors. 
                
                It is widely used as filaments for mass spectrographs. Rhenium is also used in the manufacture of electrical contact points, flashbulbs, heating elements, vacuum tubes, x-ray tubes and targets. 
                
                Rhenium is also used in various medical procedures. For example, Rhenium is used for labeling particles or diphosphonates for bone pain palliation.  Rhenium is also used for treatment of Non-Melanoma skin cancer. 
                
                
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h1>Physical and Chemical Characteristics Of Rhenium</h1>
                <h3>Rhenium is a silvery white metal. It’s extremely hard, and kind of shiny. It is a very dense metal. It's rarely seen because of its high melting point. It is a solid. Also, Rhenium has malleability, it can be hammered into thin sheets. Another cool fact is that Rhenium is ductile, it is bendable. Rhenium’s boiling point is 10,110°F and its melting point is 5,759°F. Rhenium’s density is 21.02cm3. Rhenium’s thermal conductivity is 48 W m‑1 K‑1. 

                    It resists corrosion and oxidation but slowly tarnishes in moist air Of all elements on the periodic table only a few have higher melting points. Rhenium is also very dense and only a few other elements are more dense. Rhenium is non-toxic, and it reacts with silicon, boron, and phosphorus. Rhenium is not flammable, and it will slowly tarnish in the presence of moist air.
                
                </h3>
                <br>
                <h1>Fun Facts About Rhenium</h1>
                <h3>Another really interesting fact about Rhenium is that it is the last stable, non-radioactive, naturally occurring element that has been discovered. Rhenium is rarer than most other elements. Another cool fact about Rhenium is that it can be used in jewelry but it is most likely not used. Did you know that there is only about 40 to 50 tons of Rhenium produced each year. The majority of it comes from ores that are found in Chile. It is one of the rarest elements situated in Earth’s crust. Earth’s crust contains somewhere around one-half and one part per billion of Rhenium. Rhenium’s friends are(it combines with) silicon, boron, and phosphorus. </h3>
                <br>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <h3>Overall, the reason why I picked Rhenium is because it is a very interesting and unique element among many others. Rhenium is known to have the third highest melting point of all the elements. Rhenium is also a rare element to be seen because of its high melting point. Which makes it a very unique element. Rhenium is used for many useful things. Basically, Rhenium is one of the coolest and awesomest element.</h3>
